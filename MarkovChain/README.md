# Markov Chains
This is a simple ground up implementation of a Markow Chain simulation in
Haskell.  It does not use any libraries apart from random number generation and
plotting and has been undertaken as a beginners exercise in a purely functional
programming language.  Even the datastructures for the sparse jumpmatrix are
not optimized for performance.
